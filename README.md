# Folio: Effortless Internal Tool Development

Folio is a tool I built to save time on the boring stuff. After years of building internal tools and getting stuck on UI work, I created Folio to automatically generate UIs from Go structs, letting me skip the front-end hassle and focus on the fun parts of development.

In this example, we define a `Person` struct with various fields and tags for validation and rendering. Folio automatically generates a user interface for the `Person` model, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete records.

```go
type Person struct {
    folio.Meta `kind:"person" json:",inline"`
    Name       string    `json:"name" form:"rw" is:"required"`
    Age        int       `json:"age" form:"rw" is:"range(0|130)"`
    Gender     string    `json:"gender" form:"rw" is:"required,in(male|female|prefer_not_to)"`
    Country    string    `json:"country" form:"rw"`
    Address    string    `json:"address" form:"rw"`
    Phone      string    `json:"phone" form:"rw"`
    Boss       folio.URN `json:"boss" form:"rw" kind:"person"`
    IsEmployed bool      `json:"isEmployed" form:"rw" desc:"Is the person employed?"`
    JobTitle   string    `json:"jobTitle" form:"rw"`
    Workplace  folio.URN `json:"workplace" form:"rw" kind:"company" query:"namespace=*;match=Inc"`
}
```

The generated UI includes form fields for each struct field, as well as buttons for creating, updating, and deleting records. The UI also supports pagination, sorting, and filtering.

## Introduction

Iâ€™ve built a lot of internal tools over the years â€” everything from experimentation platforms to machine learning management tools. And while those tools were powerful, the process often felt like a never-ending cycle of reinventing the wheel, except this wheel was for a car that I didnâ€™t really want to drive.

The problem? The minor stuff always took way more time and energy than it should. Need a UI for CRUD operations? Thatâ€™ll be hours of React, CSS, and front-end misery. I just wanted to get things done, not spend my weekends pretending to enjoy writing JavaScript.

Thatâ€™s where this project comes in. I built this for my personal projects where I have no team, no budget, and letâ€™s be honest â€” no patience for building full-blown React apps. Folio generates the UI for me straight from my Go structs (view models), so I can focus on the fun parts (or at least the parts that donâ€™t make me want to quit tech and become a beekeeper).

In short: Folio takes care of the boring stuff, so you can keep your focus on the good stuffâ€”like actually building cool things instead of wrangling with endless form fields and dropdowns.

Keep in mind that this project is still in its early stages, so thereâ€™s a lot of room for improvement. I'm also not going to pretend that this is the best solution for every project, and there's still a ton of features that I want to add, so use it at your own risk.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Auto-Generated UI**: Automatically generates user interfaces from view models, eliminating the need for manual UI creation.
- **CRUD Operations**: Simplifies Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for objects.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Provides utilities for error handling and validation.
- **Templating**: Uses the `templ` package to define and render HTML templates.
- **Abstracted Storage**: Supports SQLite database operations, but can be extended to other storage solutions.
- **Pagination, Search and Filtering**: Built-in support for paginated lists, search, and namespace (i.e project) filtering.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

1. Navigate to the company example directory:

   ```sh
   cd examples/company &&  go run .
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7000`.

### ðŸ“š Usage

#### Defining Models

Define your models by embedding `folio.Meta` and specifying field tags for validation and form rendering.

```go
type Person struct {
    folio.Meta `kind:"person" json:",inline"`
    Name       string    `json:"name" form:"rw" is:"required"`
    Age        int       `json:"age" form:"rw" is:"range(0|130)"`
    Gender     string    `json:"gender" form:"rw" is:"required,in(male|female|prefer_not_to)"`
    Country    string    `json:"country" form:"rw"`
    Address    string    `json:"address" form:"rw"`
    Phone      string    `json:"phone" form:"rw"`
    Boss       folio.URN `json:"boss" form:"rw" kind:"person"`
    IsEmployed bool      `json:"isEmployed" form:"rw" desc:"Is the person employed?"`
    JobTitle   string    `json:"jobTitle" form:"rw"`
    Workplace  folio.URN `json:"workplace" form:"rw" kind:"company" query:"namespace=*;match=Inc"`
}
```

#### Registering Models

Register your models with the registry and provide options like icons, titles, and sorting.

```go
reg := folio.NewRegistry()
folio.Register[*Person](reg, folio.Options{
    Icon:   "user-round",
    Title:  "Person",
    Plural: "People",
    Sort:   "1",
})
```

#### Starting the Server

Use the render.ListenAndServe function to start the server.

```go
db, err := sqlite.Open("file:data.db?_journal_mode=WAL", reg)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

if err := render.ListenAndServe(7000, reg, db); err != nil {
    slog.Error("Failed to start server!", "details", err.Error())
    os.Exit(1)
}
```
